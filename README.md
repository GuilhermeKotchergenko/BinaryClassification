# 🧠 ML I Assignment – Fighting Class Imbalance (Binary Classification)

A hands-on machine learning project for U.Porto's **Machine Learning I (CC2008)** course, focused on improving classification performance on **imbalanced binary datasets**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Challenge**: Class imbalance — real-world datasets rarely play fair.
- **Approach**: Implemented a classic ML algorithm from scratch and made it smarter.
- **Goal**: Boost performance where the minority class actually matters.

## 🛠️ What We Did

- Chose and coded a classifier in **pure Python** (no scikit-learn).
- Evaluated it on benchmark imbalanced datasets.
- Proposed & tested a custom tweak to handle skewed classes.
- Compared results using **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, and cross-validation.

## 🗂️ Key Files

- `notebook/`: 📓 Full code & experiments
- `src/`: ⚙️ Core implementation (original + improved)
- `slides/`: 🖼️ PDF deck (12-min presentation)

## 💡 Outcome

Improved minority class recall without sacrificing overall accuracy — a step toward fairer, smarter classifiers.
